# starwarsscript

The goal of this project was character analysis. The code was to address the Star Wars script and count who spoke the most, the words used most by the character(s) who spoke most, and who was most negative/positive. The code written cleans the data from the script, counts how many times characters speak, and deposits this into a dictionary that is produced when called for. The dataset was obtained as a text file through Kaggle.
